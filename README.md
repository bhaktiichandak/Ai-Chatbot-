# Ai-Chatbot-
This is a simple rule-based chatbot built in Python for a dental clinic. It greets users, answers 5 frequently asked questions (e.g., working hours, location, appointments), and responds with a default message for unknown queries. The chatbot runs in the terminal and uses basic conditional logic without any machine learning.
